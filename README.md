# Carnegie Mellon Drama's A Hit Dog Will Holler.

# Functionality notes:

<!-- 
- [ ] Everyone in the audience makes an account. The admin has an account 
      already. Instead of being taken to the blog page upon login, 
      the admin is taken to the admin page.

- [ ] When the audience makes an account, they must put in a UNIQUE username 
      and a password. They need to confirm that password too. If someone has 
      the username already, they will be prompted to pick another. They have 
      the option to choose a profile picture. If they do, the picture shows up 
      right there on the sign up page in place of the default.

- [ ] If the audience already made an account and somehow got logged out, they 
      can log in through the log in page.

- [ ] Upon log in, the audience is taken to the blog page. They can choose ONE 
      reaction for each post. If they click one, the tally goes up on EVERY 
      audience member’s phone. They can press the reaction again to un-react 
      (in which case the tally goes down for everyone). They can press another 
      reaction, in which case the tally goes down for the previous reaction and 
      the tally goes up for the newly selected one.

- [ ] The audience members’ profile photos show up next to the “Add a comment 
      as [username]…” (with each of their unique usernames) box. They can type 
      a comment, submit it, and the submitted comment will be added to the 
      BOTTOM of the comment section (i.e. newest comments at the bottom, oldest 
      at the top), with their profile picture and username displayed. This will 
      show up immediately on everybody’s phones. There is no collapsible 
      feature for comments. However long the comment section becomes is how 
      long it will become.

- [ ] The admin presses the go button for each blog post cue. The new blog post 
      will immediately be added to the TOP of the blog page (i.e. newest posts 
      at the top, oldest at the bottom).

- [ ] The admin can unpublish a post in case of error (say, the cue was 
      accidentally pressed too quickly). The comments and reactions attributes 
      that were added before the post was unpublished should stay/show up again 
      when it’s republished.

- [ ] The admin can unpublish all posts at the end of the night with the 
      “Unpublish all” button, in which case all the comments and reactions 
      SHOULD be deleted so the next show can start fresh.

- [ ] Every account made by the audience members should be deleted at the end 
      of the night, except for the admin.

- [ ] There should be a way for the admin to somehow manually delete comments 
      (and even users if the username/profile picture is inappropriate) if 
      something highly inappropriate is said. I doubt it, but this should 
      absolutely be put in place in case. For that reason, someone should also 
      be monitoring the comments coming in. I don’t anticipate many people will 
      use the comments, and I do believe people will be kind and play along, 
      but we shouldn’t risk it.
